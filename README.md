# Retail Manager
A retail management system. Based on TimCo Retail Manager, a tutorial series by Tim Corey.

# How It Started
My retail manager personal project was originally based on a tutorial series by Tim Corey called "TimCo Retail Manager". The project started in .NET Framework with a WPF application, ASP.NET Web API, and SQL Server with Dapper.


# What I Plan to Change
This was a basic introduction to working with legacy applications and preparing them to be upgraded to .NET Core. I edited the basic layout and plan to add entirely new features compared to the original TimCo tutorial.

Planned Additional Features
* Full User Account Creation
* Payment Systems Integrated
* Complete User Interface Overhaul
* Receipt System with Mailing
* Server-Side Shopping Cart
